[Pseudo-LiDAR from Visual Depth Estimation: Bridging the Gap in 3D Object Detection for Autonomous Driving](https://arxiv.org/abs/1812.07179)

_Jun 2019_

### Summary of the main idea.
The paper propose a approach to conduct 3D detection using  monocular or stero image called pseudo-lidar. The author propose a method which operate in two phases : 1) estimate the depth of the input image 2) conduct 3D detection based on pseudo lidar data generated from the estimated depth.
